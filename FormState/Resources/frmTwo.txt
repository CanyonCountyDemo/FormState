  <p>The first form you saw only had a big button to load up this screen (The about button is actually owned by the base form).</p>
  <p>This form has two different buttons that take the user down two different paths. The back button (which is now enabled) will take you back the way you came.</p>
  <p>The challenge without a state machine is keeping track of where the user goes. With a state machine the programmer just has to do this.</p>
  <p><pre>StateMachine.Instance().Navigate("frmThree");</pre></p>
  <p>All the above code is doing is calling a static method of a singleton class and telling it which screen should be next.</p>
  <p>That's ALL the code you need to add - this help text is handled by the StateMachine as well!</p>
